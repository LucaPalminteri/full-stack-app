## Explanation

This application is divided in two main parts; Front-End and Back-End.

### Front-End
I developed the user interface with the React library. The project uses react-router-dom, axios.

- [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)

### Back-End
The server for this project runs locally, I use Xampp Application. Whit Xampp I'm able to use Apache server and MySQL on differents ports. I configured some settings in order to work properly. The Back-End language is JavaScript with NodeJS.
